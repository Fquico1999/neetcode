"""
Difficulty: Medium

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:
Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Solved in O(n) time.
